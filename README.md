# Pokedex CLI

This is a pokedex cli application written in Go. It was a learning exercise from [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/assignments/dff17f87-1ce8-43ce-a43b-2cb611ce76f1). Data is from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). 


## Commands

- `catch` <pokemon_name>: Attempts to catch a pokemon and add it to your pokedex
- `exit`: Exit the Pokedex
- `explore`: Lists the Pokemon in your current location area. You don't have a starting location, so make sure you `travel` to a location area first.
- `help`: Displays a help message
- `inspect` <pokemon_name>: View information about a caught pokemon
- `map`: Displays the next 20 location areas
- `mapb`: Displays the previous 20 location areas
